With the development of technology, door lock technology is gradually developing. There are various types of digital door locks to biometric door locks. As door lock technology develops, it is difficult to find a place that does not use door locks. 

Door locks are mainly used at the front door of a home, but we investigated the inconveniences of the door locks at the company doorway felt by the employees as the target company. Therefore, we designed the face recognition door lock which can solve the disadvantages of the door lock that office workers think. 

Our door locks were made using Raspberry Pi, Pi camera, Open CV, and APP Inventor. The difference from other door locks is that the door is opened only by face recognition during the day and double security by app and face recognition at night.

## 2. Introduce & Motivation
 
 office workers or researchers, They feel a lot of inconveniences in the entrance digital door lock of the lab or office. Because the doors are always locked when you leave the lab or office for a short period of time. So If the door is locked, it becomes inconvenient to have a password or fingerprint recognition every time you enter the office again. Because of this inconvenience, people are opening the office door. But if you continue to open the door, energy is wasted and peddler can visit. If you visit a lot of people, office people may feel psychologically uneasy about security. Therefore, in order to solve the problems of company doors, we made face recognition door locks targeting companies. The advantage of face recognition door lock is that it is possible to open the door lock without using the hand, and it is possible to solve the inconvenience of fingerprint recognition or password input every time of frequent entrance and exit. 
Also, if you use a camera with good performance, you can open the door quickly because you can recognize the face from a distance. The company is the our target so, our door locks can be secured by dividing the time between day and night. Because there are always people in the office during the day, primary security is safe. In addition, since employees are frequent in the daytime, the entrance is controlled only by face recognition in order to avoid the inconvenience of fingerprint recognition or password authentication. At night, because there is no one in the office and security is very important.
so, we are used double-security by appending an employee number login APP to the door lock.
