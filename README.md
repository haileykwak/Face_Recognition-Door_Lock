## 1. Abstract

With the development of technology, door lock technology is gradually developing. There are various types of digital door locks to biometric door locks. As door lock technology develops, it is difficult to find a place that does not use door locks. 

Door locks are mainly used at the front door of a home, but we investigated the inconveniences of the door locks at the company doorway felt by the employees as the target company. Therefore, we designed the face recognition door lock which can solve the disadvantages of the door lock that office workers think. 

Our door locks were made using Raspberry Pi, Pi camera, Open CV, and APP Inventor. The difference from other door locks is that the door is opened only by face recognition during the day and double security by app and face recognition at night.
